      <p class="pad-b-1-2 milli gutter push-none">#School Project #Illustation #AR</p>
      <p class="gutter push-none wrapper">Graduation design works in 2020. This is an educational poster that combines AR technology with the theme of opposing the expansion of nuclear weapons around the world. Using AR technology to attract peopleâ€™s attention and let people pick up their phones and use Snapchat to gradually understand the hazards of different stages after nuclear weapons explosions and induce people to click to visit the <a href="https://www.icrc.org/en/nuclear-ban-treaty-no-to-nukes">ICRC No-To-Nukes </a>website to make the website get more attention. If you are interested in my work, please scan the QR code below with your Snapchat!</p>

    <p class="push-none page gutter pad-b-1-4">AR poster is a good idea. It gives people another way to observe. With the rise of technology, I fable that many such printed products will appear in the future.</p>
    <p class="push-none page gutter pad-b-1-4">Regarding this project, its progress is not as difficult as I imagined, but due to time constraints, I did not think of a good plan to combine illustrations and texts, making the text on the screen too crowded and affecting the reading experience , Maybe I made a mistake in my design from the beginning, that is to use only simple text in the AR display to improve readability and aesthetics.</p>
    <p class="push-none page gutter pad-b-1-4">In summary, this is a bold and interesting attempt and this project successfully won an A+.</p>
