      <p class="pad-b-1-2 milli gutter push-none">#C4D #AR</p>
      <p class="gutter push-none wrapper pad-b-1-2">Since 2016, the rapid development of AR technology, countless AR products are trying to change our lifestyle. From time to time, I heard in the news that some young people broke into the military restricted area just to catch Pokémon，this This made me realize that many people are really obsessed with this technology. This can't help me wonder when C4D, blender and Maya have become a designer-based skill, will the next new technology be far away, or maybe AR will be the direction of future designers?</p>
      <p class="gutter push-none wrapper">I chose Lens Studio as the platform for getting started with AR. Lens Studio is Snapchat's production and upload software. Learning from the tutorial on YouTube, making a Lens and uploading it to Snapchat is easier than I thought.</p>

    <h2 class="gutter push-none pad-b-1-2">PROCESS</h2>
    <p class="push-none page gutter pad-b-1-4">I built a model of a little shack through C4D and imported the model into Lens Studio. I also made lighting animations in C4D. Unfortunately, Lens Studio does not support the original animation of the model. I also added music box background music to the lens to try to shape the atmosphere more peacefully. Most of the time spent in the entire project is on making models, and the biggest challenge is to make animation effects on Lens Studio, which requires learning javascript to achieve. This is an amazing attempt for me. If you are interested in my work, please scan the QR code with your Snapchat!</p>
