      <p class="gutter pad-b-1-2 milli push-none">#School Projcet #Team Work</p>
      <p class="gutter push-none pad-b-1-2">The City of Ottawa has helped implement cycling as a mode of transportation by using signage and pavement markings to provide a safe experience for everyone. This study conducts research on why the pathway etiquette policies and signs are currently not effective, what can be improved about the signs and why there are continuing conflicts with cyclists and pedestrians sharing the same space. One thing we will be looking at will be the frustrations and experiences of using a pathway. </p>
      <p class="gutter push-none">The study will look at what is working and not working with the current signage and pavement markings. Through this study we targeted people who are above the age of 16 who use the pathways in the city of Ottawa. The goal, ultimately, will be to improve the experience of using the pathway. After three deliberations with the client and gaining feedback from two focus groups, we were able to create a prototype that combined client input, design principles and accessibility.</p>

    <h2 class="gutter push-none pad-b-1-2">METHODS</h2>
    <p class="push-none page gutter pad-b-1-4">The team conducted research to collect data about the effectiveness of Pathway Etiquette Policies and signs. We completed a formal application for ethics approval through the Research and Ethics Board at Algonquin College, which is attached to the appendix of this document.. Once the data collection method was approved, the team provided a survey using Google forms for cyclists, pedestrians, skateboarders or anyone who uses the paths. This survey was used to gain insight on the thoughts and concerns about pathway etiquette policies and signs. The team shared this survey using email and Facebook. We then generated graphs and charts using Google Excel to compare the data retrieved from the participants responses. We also worked with the client to receive feedback from them throughout the design process. We took a co-design approach to working with the client, and they participated in design decisions for two meetings leading up to the final drafts. After the final drafts were made, two different prototypes were presented to focus groups. These groups provided valuable insight and feedback which we took into consideration for our final prototype.</p>
