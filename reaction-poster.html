    <p class="island gutter-2 push-none"> My team was tasked to redesign the Pathway Etiquette Policy sign in the City of Ottawa to help resolve continuing conflicts that is experienced when using the shared pathways. We created an online survey to gain insightful feedback from people who use multipurpose pathways. We also conducted extensive research on literature related to shared pathways, building on prior academic knowledge. Based on our findings, the team saw that the main problem was that people are not seeing or not wanting to read the sign due to the large amount of text. We found that by decreasing the amount and increasing the size of the text, as well as adding visual representations, the problem is successfully addressed. As a member of the team, my role is to assist the team with investigation and research and design and production of the final display poster. Quoted in Re-action show.</p>
