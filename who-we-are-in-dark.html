    <p class="island gutter-2 push-none bold">This design is fictional and for educational purposes only!</p>
    <p>Choreographed by acclaimed Canadian dance artist Peggy Baker, who we are in the dark offers the immediacy of daring contemporary dance, supercharged live music, and sophisticated design elements from artists working with pigment, projection, and light. For the design of this poster, the poster shows the power and passion of modern dance with the stills on the stage as the background. The title of the poster is composed of bold sans-serif font, and the gradient title of black and white adds the texture of light and shadow. The overall layout of the poster is a 3 to 2 upper and lower structure. All paragraphs are highly aligned, which is the gospel for patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p>
